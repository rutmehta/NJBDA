Advanced Java for Business Applications is a continuation of Java for 
Business Applications. 

Students code business application programs in a complete object-oriented 
environment 

applying advanced concepts such as advanced GUI and graphics programming 
Swing and 2D 

Graphics, collections, exception handling, multithreading, multimedia, file 
input/output, 

database connectivity JDBC, internationalization, and networking.



Objectives:

1. Design and develop Java 2D graphics and GUI-based application and 
programs. 

2. Write Java programs that demonstrate advanced programming techniques.

3. Write Java programs that use file input/output.

4. Write Java programs that retrieve, manipulate and update data residing in 
a relational 

database.

5. Write Java programs that communicate across networks.



Accomplishment of student learning objectives will be assessed primarily 
through written 

exams and projects.
