VII.Detailed Course Description



    MTH 127Basic Calculus



This course follows an intuitive approach to calculus and it includes 
differential and integral calculus, and multivariable calculus. Emphasis is 
on applications of calculus to business, economics, management science and 
social science. 





VIII.Outline of Course Objectives



The General Education goals for this course require:



1. Students will use critical thinking and problem solving skills in 
analyzing information gathered through different media and from a variety of 
sources. 

2. Students will apply appropriate mathematical and statistical concepts and 
operations to interpret data and to solve problems. 





Course Objectives:



Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to:



1. Calculate derivatives and solve problems involving rate of change.

2. Find maximum and minimum values of single variable functions.

3. Graph functions.

4. Evaluate exponential and logarithm functions.

5. Calculate indefinite integrals and definite integrals.

6. Find the area under the curve.

7. Find maximum and minimum values of functions of two variables, and of 
functions of several variables subject to a constraint equation. 

8. Apply derivatives and integrals to solve problems in the life and social 
sciences.
