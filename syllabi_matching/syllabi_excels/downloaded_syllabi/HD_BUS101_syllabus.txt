      Basic mathematical principles will be

      reemphasized and then students will be

      exposed to a variety of business

      applications of these mathematical

      principles.  Students will learn the

      similarity of mathematics used in both

      personal and business applications such

      as Bank Reconciliation, discounts,

      Payroll, simple and compound interest,

      credit cards.  Financial analyses of

Upon successful completion of the course the

student should

be able to:



            Enhance students basic mathematical ability

    Provide students with a thorough understanding

of the mathematics involved in business

    Students will gain personal knowledge of the

mathematics which affects them as consumers and wage

earners

    Recognition of the planning which must go into

business decisions and how they are monitored

    Collect and organize numerical data identify

and apply appropriate mathematical techniques

interpret and present data in a variety of formats
