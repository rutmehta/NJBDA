II. Catalog Description 
Prerequisite: MATH 113 Precalculus II, MATH 114H Precalculus Honors, or a 
satisfactory score on a placement test. A one-semester course in Calculus as applied 
to business, economics, the behavioral sciences, the social sciences, and biology. 
Topics include the basic principles of limits; continuity; derivatives of algebraic, 
trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions; the study of antiderivatives; 
the integral of algebraic, trigonometric, and exponential functions; and applications of 
the integral. Credit will not be given for both Applied Calculus and Calculus I.
