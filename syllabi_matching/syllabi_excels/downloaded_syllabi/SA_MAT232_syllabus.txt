Course Description:      This course is designed for

students who need additional calculus

               for their major area of study or as

               preparation for higher levels of mathematics.

               Topics include applications of integration,

               techniques of integration, indeterminate

               forms, LHopitals Rule, improper integrals,

               sequences, and series.

Course Requirements and Means of Evaluation:



     Assignments:

          Homework will be assigned at the end of each class

     period, and questions

          will be answered the following class.  Homework

should be completed

          neatly, showing all work.  These assignments

     should be kept in some

          organized manner for further reference.  A valid

     attempt on every problem

          assigned is expected, not a correct answer on

     every problem assigned.

          The quizzes and exams will follow the same pattern

     as the homework.



     Quizzes and Exams:

          Quizzes (5 or more) 10 points each

          Exams (3 or more) 100 points each

          Final Exam (comprehensive) 200 points



     Course Grade: (based on a percentage of total possible

points)

          A    93 - 100

          A-   90 - 92

          B   88 - 89

          B    83 - 87

          B-   80 - 82

          C   78 - 79

          C    73 - 77

          C-   70 - 72

          D    60 - 67

          F     59



Attendance:  Students are expected to attend all schedules

classes.



Academic Honesty Policy:

     Students found to have committed an act of academic

dishonesty may be subject

     to failure in this course, academic probation, and/or

suspension from the college.

     See the Student Handbook for additional details.



Course Activities:

     Students will learn from lectures during which new

material

     will be delivered, small group discussions, individual

explorations,

     practice work, and discussion of assigned homework

problems.  Students will

     have the opportunity to investigate calculus using

     Mathematica software.
