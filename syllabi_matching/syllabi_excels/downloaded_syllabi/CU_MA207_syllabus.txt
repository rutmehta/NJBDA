CUMBERLAND COUNTY COLLEGE

Course:  MA 207 Linear Algebra Lab for Engineers
Credits:  1
Contact Hours:  2
Prerequisites
MA140: Calculus II

Description
This is a linear algebra lab designed to prepare engineering students for their Differential Equations course.  Topics include vector operations, matrix row operations, matrix operations, determinants, vector spaces and subspaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization and spectral decomposition, various applications, and numerical methods.  Students will be introduced to new concepts in a lecture format and will then experiment with those concepts in a lab setting using mathematical software.

Learning Objectives  
At the completion of this course, students should be able to:
• Perform various operations using matrix and vector algebra. 
• Solve systems of equations (and their applications) using Gaussian Elimination, as well as multiplication of the coefficient matrix inverse (if possible).
• Use vector space properties to confirm a set of vectors is a vector space, and determine the basis and span of a given vector set.  Continue to apply the vector space principles throughout coursework.
• Discuss the four Fundamental Subspaces of a matrix, and state the Rank Theorem.
• Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for square matrices, and use their results in various application, including raising matrices to high powers and spectral decomposition. 
• Obtain the LU and QR forms of a matrix 
• Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors numerically using a variety of methods.

Required Texts and Other Materials 
To Be Determined.
Additional Considerations:  Class must take place in a room with computers, and one in which mathematics software can be installed on all computers. 
Student Assessment
Assessment may be accomplished through online homework assignments and projects, portfolios, exams, presentations and/or papers.

Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is cheating.  Plagiarism is presenting in written work, in public speaking, and in oral reports the ideas or exact words of someone else without proper documentation.
Whether the act of plagiarism is deliberate or accidental [ignorance of the proper rules for handling material is no excuse], plagiarism is, indeed, a “criminal” offense.
As such, a plagiarized paper or report automatically receives a grade of ZERO and the student may receive a grade of F for the semester at the discretion of the instructor.

Before Withdrawing From This Course
If a student experiences adverse circumstances while enrolled in this course and considers withdrawing, s/he should see an advisor (division or advisement center) BEFORE withdrawing from the class.  A withdrawal may cause harmful repercussions to completion rate standards and overall GPA which can limit or eliminate future financial aid in addition to causing academic suspension.
