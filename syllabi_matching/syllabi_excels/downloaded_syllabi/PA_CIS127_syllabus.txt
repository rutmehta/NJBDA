PART VI: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR A NEW COURSE



     Rationale:

          There is an increasing demand for the Microsoft Office Specialist

     (MOS) exams within the industry.  The current courses offered by the

     CIS Department cover advanced topics within Microsoft Excel and

     Access, but not Microsoft Word.  In addition, the only current course

     that covers Microsoft PowerPoint is the CIS 101 course, and the topics

     covered there are only intended to serve as an introduction to the

     basic features of the tool.  Even in their academic careers at PCCC,

     students are being expected to put together presentations for their

     classes, and this course is an elective that could help these students

     as well.  The books we have selected for this course are Microsoft

     Office Specialist approved courseware, and map directly to the

     objectives that make up the MOS examinations that this course would

     prepare students for.



     Programs required in: This course will be required in the AAS.CIS

(Business Technology) option



     Courses replaced, if any: none



     Number of courses now required in discipline: This course is part of a

     new option that contains 66 credits.

     

     Suggested offering cycle: Fall/Spring or Fall/Summer



     Special equipment needed: Microsoft Office 2003



     Additional faculty: None



     Projected enrollment: 15-20



     Overload: Possible



     Projected additional operational costs: None
