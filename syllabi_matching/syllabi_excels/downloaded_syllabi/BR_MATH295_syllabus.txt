DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION

MATH 295 is a course designed for students who wish to study

an advanced topic in mathematics not included in one of our

currently offered courses.  Topics may be in a variety of

areas, including fractal geometry, statistics and

probability theory, abstract algebra and others.  Before

registering for this course, the student must obtain a

faculty advisor who will develop and submit a detailed

program of study for the student. This program of study must

be approved by the Department Chair and Division Chair prior

to registration.  A Special Project Course Contract must

be signed by the student and the faculty advisor.  This

contract will clearly outline what is expected in the

project.  Upon successful completion of this course, the

student will earn from one to three credits based upon the

topics covered.





REQUIREMENTS

  1.   The student must meet with his/her faculty advisor on a

     weekly basis throughout the semester.

2.   The student must keep an accurate log (portfolio) of all

work.

3.   The student must meet all deadlines set by faculty advisor.



 OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES

The following objectives are included in this course:

       Communicate information and ideas clearly and effectively in

     written form.

    Identify a problem and analyze it.

    Be able to analyze, discuss, and use quantitative

information.

    Be able to apply algebraic and/or geometric techniques to

analyze and solve mathematical problems.

    Be able to use appropriate problem solving technologies.



   The course project and other assignments are used to

assess student attainment of these competency objectives

within the context of the course curriculum.





GRADE DETERMINANTS

The grade for this course will be based on a portfolio evaluation

by the faculty advisor and a final report that may be given as a

written or oral presentation.  The presentation requirements will

be specified by the faculty advisor.
