Catalog Description:

A course in the mathematical theory of statistics.  Topics include counting 
techniques and mathematical probability random variables and probability 
distributions applications to sampling theory, hypothesis testing and 
correlation and regression. 



General Education Goals

The aggregate of the core courses will have the following goals:

1. To enable students to become more aware of the different perspectives 
emanating from a culturally diverse population. 

2. To emphasize critical thinking and problem solving to the extent 
possible, to include quantitative reasoning and research skills, including 
accessing information from a variety of sources and media 

3. To enable students to increase proficiency in writing, reading, speaking, 
and listening skills 

4. To require students to prepare and present information with the use of 
computers 



Course Objectives:

This course exposes students to discrete and continuous case methods in 
mathematical probability and statistics as used by statisticians, engineers 
and other mathematics intensive decision makers.
