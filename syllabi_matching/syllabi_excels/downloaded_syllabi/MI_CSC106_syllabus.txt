DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course introduces students to a problem solving approach to computer 
applications through the use 

of spreadsheets, database, presentation manager, a programming language and 
Internet skills. It 

emphasizes Visual Basic and Microsoft Excel, in addition to surveying 
fundamental computer concepts, 

and is designed for students who already possess a familiarity with computer 
applications.  It is 

recommended for students planning to transfer to an upper division college 
that has a computer 

programming requirement in its computer literacy course.  This course is 
suitable for liberal arts, science 

and business students.



OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES



1.Demonstrate effective use of the Internet to do research and build a web
