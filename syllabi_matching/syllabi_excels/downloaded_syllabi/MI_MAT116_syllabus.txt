DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION:



This course is designed to prepare students for general education science 
and 

mathematics electives.  Topics include concepts of algebra, algebraic 
functions 

and 

graphs, exponential and logarithmic functions and graphs, inequalities and 

systems of 

equations.  Applications are emphasized.









OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES



The student will demonstrate through quizzes, examinations, written 

homework, laboratory reports, and projects the ability to:



1.interpret charts and graphs and discover the relationships among the 

variables involved.



2.use various modes to present data and functions.



3.perform basic algebraic manipulations.



4.relate sentences to formulas, tables, and graphs.



5.compute and describe qualitative rates of change.



6.identify the mathematics characteristics of linear, exponential, 

logarithmic, 

power, and quadratic functions.



7.apply mathematical principles to solving practical problems.
