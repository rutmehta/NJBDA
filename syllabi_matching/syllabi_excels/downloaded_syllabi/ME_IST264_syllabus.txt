Audit:
If you audit the course, you will receive an “X” grade—this cannot be changed to
a letter grade at a later date.


Withdrawal Course Requirements:
To receive a W grade for any course, a student must consult with the course
instructor or an appropriate division representative and then withdraw officially
before two-thirds of the course has been completed by submitting a withdrawal
form to the Office of Student Records. Withdrawal after this point results in a
grade other than W (usually F). At any time before two-thirds of the course has
been completed, the instructor may also withdraw with a W grade any student
who has been absent excessively. A student thus withdrawn will not be entitled
to any refund of tuition or fees. The student may appeal this action.
