CLASS POLICIES
1.	It is the student's responsibility to read the chapter prior to the 
classroom presentation.
2.	Tests cannot be made up. A grade of zero will be given for any missed 
test.
3. 	It is important to check the ANGEL site for announcements and dates.
4.	Assignments are due on the assigned date. Assignments must be submitted 
electronically as 
well as hard copy.
5.	Late work will be accepted up to three calendar days after the due 
date. Eleven points will 
be deducted for each day the assignment is late.
6.	If you do not finish the assigned work during class time, it is your 
responsibility to use the 
open lab.
7.	If you miss more than two lectures, your grade may be penalized. For 
every class that is 
missed beyond the second absence, your final grade may be lowered by two 
points, i.e., if 
your final grade is 90 and you miss a total of four classes, your final grade 
will be 86.
8.	Use of electronic devices (cellular/digital phones, MP3 players, radio, 
CD players, etc.) is 
strictly prohibited. Be sure to disengage sound before class begins. 
Calculators, PDAs, 
handhelds, and computers are prohibited during examinations unless taking 
performance-
based examinations.
9.	Any acts of classroom disruption that go beyond the normal rights of 
students to question 
and discuss with instructors the educational process relative to subject 
content will not be 
tolerated, in accordance with the Academic Code of Conduct described in the 
Student 
Handbook. See the Student Handbook for the policy on 'Academic Integrity.' I 
strongly 
support the policy regarding academic behavior and disruptive behavior.

COURSE POLICIES
Preparing for Examinations
Read the chapter prior to the lecture. Keep up with the assignments. 

In Case You Are Late or Absent 
It is your responsibility to get the course notes, handouts, and laboratory 
assignments should you 
miss class or be late. See instructor either after class or during office 
hours.

Appeals Policy
To appeal a grade, send an email to your instructor through ANGEL mail within 
one week of the 
grade having been received. Overdue appeals will not be considered.

Incomplete Policy
Students will not be given an incomplete grade in the course without sound 
reason and 
documented evidence as described in the Student Handbook. In any case, for a 
student to 
receive an incomplete, he or she must be passing and must have completed a 
significant portion 
of the course.

Cheating Policy
Students are expected to uphold the school's standard of conduct relating to 
academic honesty. 
Students assume full responsibility for the content and integrity of the 
academic work they 
submit. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be that a student's 
submitted work, 
examinations, reports, and projects must be that of the student's own work. 
Students shall be 
guilty of violating the honor code if they:

1.	Represent the work of others as their own work.
2.	Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic work.
3.	Give unauthorized assistance to other students.
4.	Modify, without instructor approval, an examination, paper, record, or 
report for the purpose 
of obtaining additional credit.
5.	Misrepresent the content of submitted work.

The penalty for violating the honor code is severe. Any student violating the 
honor code is 
subject to receive a failing grade for the course and may be subject to 
disciplinary action as 
described in the Student Handbook. If a student is unclear about whether a 
particular situation 
may constitute an honor code violation, the student should meet with the 
instructor to discuss the 
situation.

For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions 
of computing techniques. 
General advice and interaction are encouraged. Each person, however, must 
develop his or her 
own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. Students may 
not 'work 
together' on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes cheating, 
unless it is a grouped 
assignment. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or 
portions of it) and 
represent it as his/her own. If you need help on an assignment, contact your 
instructor, not other 
classmates.

Laboratory Policy
Homework and laboratory assignments must be submitted at the beginning of 
class on the 
scheduled due date. Assignments handed in after class begins are considered 
late.

No assignments will be accepted more than three calendar days after the due 
date. Plan to spend 
approximately eight to ten hours each week on reading, homework, and 
laboratory assignments.
 
Make sure your name, course and section, and assignment (ex. Word, Chapter 1 
Exercises; Word, 
Chapter 1 Assessments) appear on cover sheets. Chapter exercises and chapter 
assessments are 
submitted separately. Do not staple assignments from different chapters 
together. Disorganized 
assignments (pages out of order, mislabeled, unreadable, etc.) will receive a 
grade of zero. If 
there are multiple sheets/exercises to be handed in, sequence them according 
to the order they 
were assigned. All assignments for each chapter must be submitted in a folder 
that is provided by 
your instructor.

Disabilities Policy
In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all qualified 
students enrolled in 
this course are entitled to 'reasonable accommodations.' Please notify the 
instructor during the 
first week of class of any accommodations needed for the course. 

Any student with special needs that will affect performance in this class 
should feel free to make 
an appointment to talk with me during office hours (or by appointment) or 
contact the disabilities 
counselor in the Counseling office on the Cranford Campus at 908-709-7164.
