Catalog Course Description:



The first half of a two semester Precalculus course designed to give 
students 

extended enrichment to prepare for a first course in calculus.  Emphasis is 
on 

algebra topics to develop skills properly and through understanding of the 

concepts needed to go on to Calculus.  Topics include the study of algebraic 

functions and their graphs.  Of special interest are polynomials and 
rational 

functions.





Objectives of Course:

1.To acquire the working knowledge of college algebra needed for later study 

and work.



2.To use a scientific graphing calculator, computer software, and other 

resources as problem solving tools.



3.To develop awareness of the contributions of mathematicians from various 

cultures and countries.





This outline leaves time for a review session (last class meeting) and at 
least 

3 hourly tests.



The syllabus represents the basic minimum to be covered by an instructor.



Students enrolled in MAT-129A will be required to or have access to a TI 83 

calculator.
