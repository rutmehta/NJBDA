Evaluation of Student Learning / Course Grading 
Assignments: All assignments will be graded on an A to F basis. Late assignments will be subject to grade reductions of one letter grade per class session. Assignments not turned in will be recorded as a zero grade. (30% of final grade) 

Quizzes: Quizzes may be given at any time during the class. They may be written or performance based, and students may or may not be given prior notice. Quizzes missed because of student absence may not be made up and will be recorded as a zero. (30% of final grade) 

 Projects: 2-4 Sketch / drawing projects will be assigned at the beginning or end of various topic units (30% of final grade) 

Final Grade Calculation: Your final grade will be calculated by averaging all of your grades and weighing them as indicated above. 

Final Examination: Because this course requires the cumulative mastery of previously taught skills for the completion of each successive assignment, a comprehensive final examination is required to measure the attainment of course objectives. (10% of final grade)


The student is responsible for his/her regular attendance and participation in class discussions.
