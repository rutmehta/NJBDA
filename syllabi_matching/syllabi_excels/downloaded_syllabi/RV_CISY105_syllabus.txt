Goals of the Course:

        1. To understand basic concepts of computer science.

These concepts

           include problem solving, algorithms and program

development.

        2. Code, test, debug, and document Java programs.

       3. Describe the nature of structured and object

oriented programming and

            apply these concepts to the development of

efficient Java programs.













Required Materials:

        3 1/2 inch diskette (HD) and/or zip

disk, 2, twopocketed folders for handing in

        labs with documentation.



Grading:

        The following weights will be used in

determining the final grade:



                 Lab Assignments          32

Class policies:

Attendance.

      1.  Students are required to attend all

classes. You

are responsible for

           material missed due to absence(s).

      2.  Students who miss 20 of the course

may be

withdrawn from the class at

          the discretion of the instructor. This

is official school policy.

          3.  I do not routinely give make-up

quizzes. If

you cannot be present for

              an exam and you are going to want

to make it up, you must inform me

          (in person, phone, or e-mail) before

you miss the regular exam.



   Labs.

          1.  No eating or drinking in computer

labs. This is official school policy.

          2.  Copying on labs will not be

tolerated and will result in a zero (0) for that

               lab. Although I encourage you to

work together, labs must be done

               individually and should reflect

your own logic and style.

          3.  Each lab that you hand in must be

stapled if not, you will lose points.

    4.  Each lab handed in must start with an

introductory comment

               within the code of the program

We will discuss other aspects of writing

               clear code in class.



      Late Policy.

          You are expected to be in class on

time. Coming late is disruptive to

            me and to your classmates.



      Class Behavior.

          When you first come to class you

should open your text to the

            appropriate material. Usually, the

first activity will be going over homework

            problems. Students volunteer or are

asked to write selected homework

            problems on the board.



      Homework.

          All homework will be collected and

must be typed. Homework

            assignments are due on time late

assignments (next class) will receive half

     credit assignments will not be accepted

after the next class.

     If you have difficulty with some of the

problems, you can clarify

            them and modify them as we go over

the homework.



      Suggestions to students.

          You should be prepared to spend  6 to

10 hours a week outside

            of lab on reading and homework for

this course. This is a common time

  requirement for a course of this nature the

                     actual

time spent will vary for

each student depending upon her/his study habits

                       and

other factors.

          Your commitment to keep up with the

reading, homeworks and labs is

    essential to successfully completing this

                    course. I

recommend you exchange

 your e-mail address/telephone number with other

classmates for support and

     for information regarding any missed class.
