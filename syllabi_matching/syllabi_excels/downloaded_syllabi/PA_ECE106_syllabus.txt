COURSE DESCRIPTION

      This course is designed to assist the student in

learning to use natural science and physical phenomena to

develop a childs curiosity and the childs beginning

practice of the scientific method.  Simple mathematical

concepts are examined, applied, and integrated.  Both

mathematics and science are explored through hands-on

discoveries of the world around us.



COURSE OBJECTIVES

      The student will be able to:

      -    define concept development understand the importance

         of professional standards for math and science compare

         theorists stages of mental development and explain how

         children acquire knowledge.

      -    recognize, define/describe, and identify activities to

         develop fundamental concepts and skills in math and science.

      -    apply fundamental concepts, attitudes, and skills.

      -    list number symbol skills, set up an environment and do

         activities that support naturalistic and informal

         experiences describe, plan activities for, set up an

         environment, assess and evaluate the childs ability to work

         with sets and symbols and move onto higher-level concepts

         and activities.

      -    examine mathematics concepts for the primary grades.

      -    assist children in using skills, concepts, and

         attitudes for scientific investigations in the primary

         grades.

      -    arrange an early childhood math and science

         environment.

      -    write and implement math/science lesson plans for the

         early childhood program.

      -    identify the components of a thematic unit.

      -    understand how math and science concepts complement one

         another so that the integration of these two curricula is

         planned and the skills implemented in the early childhood

         setting.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS



      Presence and participation is required.  This course

is run in a lecture, discussion group, hands-on activity

mode.  Lateness diminishes participation.  Students entering

after attendance is taken can lose credit for attending

class.



     Reading Requirement

Reading the textbook is necessary to be successful in this

class in order to participate in group discussion and be

prepared for a weekly quick quiz.  In addition, reprints

of relevant articles will be distributed, discussed and

students are expected to incorporate these articles as

reference materials for their group projects.



     Written Assignments

All written assignments must be prepared on a typewriter or

word processor, and checked for spelling and grammatical

errors before being submitted.  Correct spelling and

appropriate grammar, syntax and sentence structure bring

order and logic to any written assignment.



     Weekly Quizzes

Ten (10) quick quizzes on text readings or distributed

articles will be given.  The quizzes will vary each week,

and can be one short essay question, or ten true/false or

multiple choice questions, or question construction and

response.  A student cannot make up a missed quiz.



    Lesson Plans

Following a format which will be provided, students will

write two (2) lesson plans, one each for a science

curriculum and a math curriculum.  The lesson plan is a

written assignment and should follow the criteria for such

as already stated.  Refer to Week-by-Week Syllabus for due

dates.



     Math/Science Center Project 

Students must choose a partner or work in a small group to

complete this project.  Each group will be given

15-20 minutes to demonstrate a math/science topic to a class

of young children.  Arranging to have 5-10 children

participate from our on-site childcare center in advance is

necessary.  The students will be responsible for providing

the materials/supplies necessary to complete the project.

The group will submit a written copy of the project, and

each member of the group will be assigned the same grade.



  SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF CENTER SCHEDULE/ENROLLMENT



      Late Assignments

Assignments submitted for a grade will lose one grade point

for each week that passes after the due date.
