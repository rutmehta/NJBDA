Student Assessment:
Assessment may be accomplished through projects, portfolios, exams, presentations and/or papers.

Academic Integrity:
Plagiarism is cheating.  Plagiarism is presenting in written work, in public speaking, and in oral reports the ideas or exact words of someone else without proper documentation.
Whether the act of plagiarism is deliberate or accidental [ignorance of the proper rules for handling material is no excuse], plagiarism is, indeed, a “criminal” offense.
As such, a plagiarized paper or report automatically receives a grade of ZERO and the student may receive a grade of F for the semester at the discretion of the instructor.

Available Resources:
If you are having difficulty with work in this class, tutoring is available through the Success Center.  If you think that you might have a learning disability, contact Project Assist at 856.691.8600, x1282 for information on assistance that can be provided to eligible students.

Before Withdrawing From This Course:
If a student experiences adverse circumstances while enrolled in this course and considers withdrawing, s/he should see an advisor (division or advisement center) BEFORE withdrawing from the class.  A withdrawal may cause harmful repercussions to completion rate standards and overall GPA which can limit or eliminate future financial aid in addition to causing academic suspension.
