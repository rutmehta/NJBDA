DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is a capstone course for students enrolled in the Computer 
Science program.  Students conduct analysis and research resulting in the 
architecture, design and implementation of an information system. Students 
develop detail descriptions of the data stores, program structures and user 
interfaces of the system. Projects give students hands-on experience to 
perform the analysis, design, coding and testing of software created. 



OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES

Students will present a deliverable for each stage of the project. The 
stages are: 

I. Project selection and overall architecture of the project.

II. Logical design of the components of the project.

III. Physical design of the components of the project.

IV. Test plans.

V. Implementation of the project



Students will participate in all critiques and presentations of other 
students work. 



Students will present their system at the time of the project evaluation.

SCHEDULE OF TOPICS TO BE COVERED

The student will develop the system architecture, logical design, physical 
design, test plans and implement a computer system to support the project. 
In addition students will: 

I. Understand web page layouts and the skills (HTML/CSS/XML) necessary to 
produce the user interface (Web Site Development Students). 

II. Employ a structured approach for testing the system.

III. Design data stores and provide the interfaces to those data stores.

IV. Understand the role and limits of the operating system and computer 
architecture in the design and implementation of the project (Programming 
Option Students). 

V. Design user interfaces which consider ergonomics.

VI. Design and implement using object oriented and generic software 
engineering principles. 

VII. Provide documentation of the developed system
