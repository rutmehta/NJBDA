DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is intended to teach the student how to analyze data and 
effectively design databases to store such data. Relational database design, 
implementation, and administration are covered. Design concepts include 
entity relationship modeling and normalization. Implementation and 
administration are covered through basic and advanced SQL. A relational 
database management system and drawing software are used in a laboratory 
environment to teach the practical application of the theories covered. 



OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES

The student will be able to create databases by applying theoretical 
principles of database design.  Implementation and administration of 
databases is demonstrated through a working knowledge of SQL.
