Catalog Course Description:



This is an introductory programming course using the C programming language. 
 Students are 

introduced to algorithm development and problem solving techniques.  
Fundamental topics of 

computer programming are discussed including: data types, operators, 
input/output, arrays, and 

control structures such as selection, repetition and functions.  No previous 
programming 

experience is required.  This course may not be taken by computer science 
majors. 









Objectives of the Course: Behavioral: 



The student should be able to:



1.   Identify the functional units of a computer and describe how 
information flows 

      through it.



2.   Discuss the program development process.





3.   Demonstrate an understanding of the syntax and semantics of C language

      statements.



4.   Understand basic control constructs of a programming language including 

      sequencing, selection, repetition and functions.

5.   Demonstrate an understanding of input from the keyboard and output to 
the 

      monitor.



6.   Manipulate one dimensional arrays.



7.   Code well-structured and properly documented source programs that 
accept input data, solve 

a specified problem and present solutions in an effective manner.



8.   Test and debug a C program.
