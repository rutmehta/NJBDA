NOTE THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:



All Computer Lab Assignments are to be completed in class.

However, if you need additional time, you will be expected

to attend a scheduled open lab or use a computer at home or

work.



All assignments must be complete no credit will be given

for incomplete work.



Assignments are to be submitted on time reduced credit will

be given for projects submitted late.



Academic Integrity Statement:



A student who a.) knowingly represents work of others as

his/her own b.) uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in

the execution of any academic work or c.) gives fraudulent

assistance to another student is guilty of cheating.

Violators will be penalized.  (Student Handbook)



Classroom Conduct Statement:



It is the students responsibility to attend all of their

classes.  If they miss a class meeting for any reason,

students are responsible for all content that is covered,

for announcements made in their absence, and for acquiring

any materials that may have been distributed in class.  It

is expected that students be on time for all their classes.

If students walk into a class after it has begun, it is

expected that they choose a seat close to where they entered

the room so that they do not disrupt the class meeting.



Students are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy

during class sessions.  Engaging in private, side

conversations during class time is distracting to other

students and to the instructor.  Leaving class early without

having informed the instructor prior to class is not

appropriate.  Unless there is an emergency, leaving class

and returning while

the class is in session is not acceptable behavior.

Disruptive behavior of any type, including sharpening

pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not

appropriate.



The college welcomes all students into an environment that

creates a sense of community of pride and respect we are

all here to work cooperatively and to learn together.
