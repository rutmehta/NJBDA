Audit:

If you audit the course, you will receive an X gradethis cannot be changed 
to 

a letter grade at a later date.



Withdrawal Course Requirements:

To receive a W grade for any course, a student must consult with the course

instructor or an appropriate division representative and then withdraw 
officially 

before two-thirds of the course has been completed by submitting a 
withdrawal 

form to the Office of Student Records. Withdrawal after this point results 
in a 

grade other than W (usually F). At any time before two-thirds of the course 
has 

been completed, the instructor may also withdraw with a W grade any student

who has been absent excessively. A student thus withdrawn will not be 
entitled 

to any refund of tuition or fees. The student may appeal this action.



Attendance Policy

Mercer County Community College does not have a cut system. Students are

expected to attend all classes of every course on their schedules. Only 
illness or 

serious personal matters may be considered adequate reasons for absence.

It is the prerogative of the instructor to excuse absences for valid 
reasons, provided the 

student will be able to fulfill all course requirements.

Student performance in classes is formally verified at each class meeting. 
If a students 

attendance has been infrequent or performance unsatisfactory, he or she may 
receive 

notification in the mail. At any time, the instructor may withdraw the 
student from class 

for insufficient attendance.



Classroom Conduct Statement

It is the students responsibility to attend all classes. If a student misses 
a class meeting 

for any reason, he/she is responsible for all content that is covered, for 
announcements 

made, and for acquiring any materials that may have been distributed in 
class. It is 

expected that students be on time for all classes. Students who walk into 
class after it 

has begun are expected to choose seats close to where they entered the room 
so that 

they do not disrupt the class meeting.



Students are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy during the class 
sessions. 

Engaging in private, side conversations during class time is distracting to 
other students 

and to the instructor. Leaving class early without having informed the 
instructor prior to 

class is not appropriate. Unless there is an emergency, leaving class and 
returning 

while the class is in session is not acceptable behavior. Disruptive 
behavior of any type, 

including sharpening pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not 
appropriate. 



The college welcomes all students into an environment that creates a sense 
of 

community of pride and respect we are here to work cooperatively and to 
learn 

together.



Academic Integrity Statement

A student who knowingly represents work of others as his/her own, uses or 
obtains 

unauthorized assistance in the execution of any academic work, or gives 
fraudulent 

assistance to another student is guilty of cheating. The penalty for 
violating the honor 

code is severe. (See Student Handbook.) Any student violating the honor code 
is 

subject to receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported to 
the Office of 

Student Affairs. If a student is unclear about whether a particular 
situation may 

constitute an honor code violation, the student should meet with the 
instructor to discuss 

the situation.



It is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions of computing 
techniques 

general advice and interaction are encouraged. Each person, however, must 
develop 

his or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. 
Students 

may not work together on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes

cheating, unless it is a group assignment. A student may not use or copy (by 
any 

means) anothers work (or portions of it) and represent it as his/her own.
