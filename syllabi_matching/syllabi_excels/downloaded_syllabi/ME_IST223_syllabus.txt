COURSE OBJECTIVES



In  this course students will learn how to use ADO.NET DataSets and

how  to  build a Data-Bound application. Students will  also  build

Windows  services, MDI applications and build reports using Crystal

Reports.  This  course  also covers security  issues  in  the  .NET

environment  and  how to deploy VB.NET applications.  Visual  Basic

.NET programmers who will be developing more advanced applications.



TESTS



There will be given a minimum of six tests/mini programs. Each test

may  contain  sentences completion, interpretation of  a  flowchart

and/or program, and may require the writing of a program or program

element.



QUIZZES



Students  should  expect  a brief quiz each  week  based  upon  the

previous lecture and reading assignment.



LABORATORY



Students  will be given a minimum of six projects to introduce  the

programming  environment  to  provide  reinforcement  of   material

presented in lecture.  All assignments will have deadlines.

Laboratory/Projects Report Scoring Guide



Scoring Standard



You  must  achieved  a  rating of at least 2  or  yes  on  each

criterion  to demonstrate competence.  Work receiving a  no  will

not  be  evaluated  further  until corrected,  and  points  may  be

deducted on a resubmission.



Rating Scale



3:    Exceeds  criterion by showing creativity, insight, precision,

or thoroughness

2:   Meets criterion at a minimum level of competence

1:   Does not meet criterion

Advanced Visual Basic .NET



In  this course students will learn how to use ADO.NET DataSets and

how  to  build a Data-Bound application. Students will  also  build

Windows  services, MDI applications and build reports using Crystal

Reports.  This  course  also covers security  issues  in  the  .NET

environment  and  how  to deploy your VB.NET applications.   Visual

Basic   .NET   programmers   will  be  developing   more   advanced

applications.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT



A  student who a.) knowingly represents work of others as  his/her

own  b.)  uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in the execution

of  any work or c.) gives fraudulent assistance to another student

is  guilty  of  cheating.  Violators will be  penalized.  (Student

Handbook)



CLASSROOM CONDUCT STATEMENT



It  is the students responsibility to attend all of their classes.

If  they  miss  a  class  meeting  for  any  reason,  students  are

responsible for all content that is covered, for announcements made

in  their  absence, and for acquiring any materials that  may  have

been  distributed in class. It is expected that students be on time

for  all their classes. If students walk into a class after it  had

begun,  it is expected that they choose a seat close to where  they

entered the room so they do not disrupt the class meeting.



Students  are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy  during

class session. Engaging in private, side conversations during class

time  is  distracting  to  other students and  to  the  instructor.

Leaving class early without having informed the instructor prior to

class  is  not  appropriate. Unless there is an emergency,  leaving

class  and  returning while class is in session is  not  acceptable

behavior.  Disruptive  behavior of any type,  including  sharpening

pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not appropriate.



The  college welcomes all students into an environment that creates

a sense of community and pride and respect we are all here to work

cooperatively and to learn together.
