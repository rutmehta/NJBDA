COURSE DESCRIPTION:

Oracle Programming with Visual Basic will be used to create event

driven programming applications to run on Windows and Server

environment.  Object oriented solutions for a variety of personal

and business computing problems will be developed.  Course includes

interfacing Visual Basic with Oracle database to optimize database

administration.

COURSE OBJECTIVES



The course is designed to provide the student with programming

skills required to create and maintain Oracle database(s), queries

and stored procedures.  Students will update data using standard

SQL commands, write procedural programming language using PL/SQL,

and write stored procedures that can communicate with Visual Basic.

Exposure will include various components required for communicating

between Visual Basic on the client and Oracle database server. Also

five most common data-access technologies will be covered.



TESTS



A minimum of six tests/mini projects will evaluate student

learning. Each test/mini project will contain sentence completion,

interpretation of a flowchart and/or program, and may require the

writing of a program or program element.



QUIZZES



Students should expect a brief quiz each week based upon the

previous lecture and reading assignment.



LABORATORY



Students will be given a minimum of six major projects to provide a

hands-on experiential component in the programming environment.

All assignments will have deadlines.



LABORATORY EVALUTION



Students performance of each laboratory assignment will be

evaluated and assigned a point value according to the following:





          Standards           0 to 2 points

                         Adherence to specified Programming

                         Standard. Programs must contain properly

                         identified modules. The minimum modules

                         for any program are: Program

                         Identification, Variable Map, Program

                         Description, Main Routine, and EOJ

                         Routine.

                         









     

     Remarks             0 to 2 point

                         Generous use of remarks within the Main

                         and Subroutines must be made.



     Use of Project Lesson    0 to 2 points

                         The Visual Basic/Oracle/both elements

                         specified in the project lesson section

                         of the assignment must be used.

          

     Execution           0 to 4 points

                         Output must be according to the projects

                    specifications.

          

     Total each project       0 to 10 points







FINAL GRADE



     The final grade is a composite based upon:



          Tests (Theory/projects/both)       40

          Laboratory Major Projects(class)             30

          Midterm Examination                15

          Final Examination                               15

Academic Integrity Statement:



A student who a.) knowingly represents work of others as his/her

own b.) uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in the execution

of any work or c.) gives fraudulent assistance to another student

is guilty of cheating. Violators will be penalized. (Student

Handbook)



Classroom Conduct Statement:



It is the students responsibility to attend all of their classes.

If they miss a class meeting for any reason, students are

responsible for all content that is covered, for announcements made

in their absence, and for acquiring any materials that may have

been distributed in class. It is expected that students be on time

for all their classes. If students walk into a class after it had

begun, it is expected that they choose a seat close to where they

entered the room so they do not disrupt the class meeting.



Students are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy during

class session. Engaging in private, side conversations during class

time is distracting to other students and to the instructor.

Leaving class early without having informed the instructor prior to

class is not appropriate. Unless there is an emergency, leaving

class and returning while class is in session is not acceptable

behavior. Disruptive behavior of any type, including sharpening

pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not appropriate.



The college welcomes all students into an environment that creates

a sense of community and pride and respect we are all here to work

cooperatively and to learn together.
