Evaluation of Student Learning
Students will receive regular feedback on their work through assignments, examinations, lab work, and projects.  The syllabus for this course should describe the schedule for these assessment tools and how they will be used to calculate grades.  Learning activities will consist of a combination of lectures, lab work and computer assignments.  The specific choices for assessment will rest with the instructor.  Outside of class, students are expected to do a significant amount of work to achieve learning goals for this course.  A typical grading scheme for this course follows:
       Exams				30%		Computer Labs	             10%
       Project				15%		Final Exam		30%
       Graded Assignments		15%


Academic Integrity Statement:  

Under no circumstance should students knowingly represent the work of another as one’s own.  Students may not use any unauthorized assistance to complete assignments or exams, including but not limited to cheat-sheets, cell phones, text messaging and copying from another student.  Violations should be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee and will be penalized.  Please refer to the Student Handbook for more details.
