Catalog Course Description:



The second half of a two semester Precalculus course designed to give 
students 

extended enrichment to prepare for a first course in calculus.  Emphasis is 
on 

exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions and their properties to 

develop skills properly for a thorough understanding of the concepts needed 
to 

go on to calculus.





Objectives of Course:

1.To acquire the working knowledge of college algebra and trigonometry 

needed for later study and work.



2.To use a scientific graphing calculator, computer software, and other 

resources as problem solving tools.



3.To develop awareness of the contributions of mathematicians from various 

cultures and countries.
