JavaScript    Lab A1





For this lab create an online catalog page that allows customers

to order and find out about their order. Build a catalog page that

lists four or five of the products. For each product provide a way

to get more information for the product and a way to order a

quantity of the product. Also provide a button that allows a

customer to see an invoice of all the requested purchases. You may

wish to use objects to help you store the product information and

methods to display the products and invoice.  A sample user

interface is shown below. You may change the design but the info

button should open a new window to display information for that

product (which includes the price). The add-to-cart button prompts

the user for the amount to purchase. The JavaScript code you write

must only allow valid numeric quantities for the amount. The Show

Invoice button displays the items that have been added to the

cart. The invoice should list only the products ordered and

provide a grand total. As a bonus add a way to delete an item from

the shopping cart. As an additional bonus store the items ordered

in cookies.
