Information resources:  The Mercer County Community College Library has a wide assortment of reference books that students may use. Students may access tutoring resources from the Carnegie Learning System.  Tutors are available during lab periods and at the West Windsor and James Kerney Learning Center.
As this is a foundations level mathematics course, the objective of the course is to prepare students to take a college-level mathematics course.  Crucial to success in a mathematics course is the ability to think “algebraically”; that is, to be able to demonstrate an ability to move beyond following prescribed algorithms into abstract reasoning.
A minimum grade of 'C' is required for movement from one developmental course to another and for the completion of developmental requirements to qualify for credit-bearing mathematics courses.

* Completion of written assignments relating course objectives in each unit to written proficiency of same (CG 1-12).
*  A comprehensive final examination to demonstrate a student’s ability to retain and apply course objectives (CG 1-12).
A suggested grading scheme follows.  Grade will be based on the following percentages: 

* Pre/Post Test Modules 				50%
* Hours in Software				10%
* Assignments 					15% 
* Final Examination				25%

o Students who score 80% or higher on a pretest will be exempt from work on that module and will move to the next module.
o Students must demonstrate a mastery level of at least 70% to move from one module to another. 
o A written assignment at the end of each module will constitute part of the student’s grade and will give the student experience with the type of work expected on the final exam.
o Assignments will be made available to instructors at the beginning of the course.
o Students should receive regular feedback on their work through lab work and assignments.
o Review packet for final exam to be provided.
o Practice exams on software to be created.
o Final exam scheduled in Testing Center.  
o Students may take the final exam only once.
