Rationale

As we all know, computes influence the daily lives of most

individuals. Todays teachers must educate students to live in

technology-rich environments. This course will teach how to use

computers, how to access and evaluate information on the World

Wide Web, and how to integrate computers and educational

technology into classroom curriculum. Todays children are not

afraid to use computers. As a result, todays educators must be

knowledgeable in educational technology. This course can be used

as part of the mandatory professional development requirements

for current K-12 educators. This course can also be sued for

individuals interested in the education field at any level - pre-

school through post-secondary.



Transferability

Kean University has a similar course in their education program.

Kean provided UCC with a copy of the course outline. UCCs course

is similar to Keans. Few four-year institutions are willing to

spend time evaluating potential courses. They would rather see

the finished product. Once approved, the course outline will be

submitted to NJTransfer for evaluation. If the institutions do

not accept the course, we will contact those schools and modify

the course as needed.



Resources and Costs

No additional expenses are required at this time.
