Audit
A student who audits the course will receive an “X” grade—this cannot be changed to a letter grade at a later date.

Withdrawal
To receive a W grade for any course, a student must consult with the course instructor or an appropriate division representative and then withdraw officially before two-thirds of the course has been completed by submitting a withdrawal form to the Office of Student Records. Withdrawal after this point results in a grade other than W (usually F). At any time before two-thirds of the course has been completed, the instructor may also withdraw with a W grade any student who has been absent excessively. A student thus withdrawn will not be entitled to any refund of tuition or fees. The student may appeal this action.

Attendance Policy
Mercer County Community College does not have a “cut system.” Students are expected to attend all classes of every course on their schedules. Only illness or serious personal matters may be considered adequate reasons for absence.  It is the prerogative of the instructor to excuse absences for valid reasons, provided the student will be able to fulfill all course requirements.

Student performance in classes is formally verified at each class meeting. If a student’s attendance has been infrequent or performance unsatisfactory, he or she may receive notification in the mail. At any time, the instructor may withdraw the student from class for insufficient attendance.

Classroom Conduct Statement
It is the student’s responsibility to attend all classes. If a student misses a class meeting for any reason, he/she is responsible for all content that is covered, for announcements made, and for acquiring any materials that may have been distributed in class. It is expected that students be on time for all classes. Students who walk into class after it has begun are expected to choose seats close to where they entered the room so that they do not disrupt the class meeting.

Students are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy during the class sessions.  Engaging in private, side conversations during class time is distracting to other students and to the instructor. Leaving class early without having informed the instructor prior to class is not appropriate. Unless there is an emergency, leaving class and returning while the class is in session is not acceptable behavior. Disruptive behavior of any type, including sharpening pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not appropriate.

The college welcomes all students into an environment that creates a sense of community of pride and respect; we are here to work cooperatively and to learn together.

Academic Integrity Statement
A student who knowingly represents work of others as his/her own, uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in the execution of any academic work, or gives fraudulent assistance to another student is guilty of cheating. The penalty for violating the honor code is severe. (See Student Handbook.)  Any student violating the honor code is subject to receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported to the Office of Student Affairs. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an honor code violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

It is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions of computing techniques; general advice and interaction are encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. Students may not 'work together' on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes cheating, unless it is a group assignment. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his/her own.
