Catalog Description 
Prerequisite or Corequisite: GPA of 3.5 or permission of the instructor. MATH 111 
Statistics II, or MATH 117H Statistics Honors. This is an honors component to 
supplement the existing MATH 117H Statistics Honors or MATH 111 Statistics II 
courses. Students will become familiar with the concepts and techniques of 
experimental design within the context of a research situation. Students will learn to 
incorporate statistical software to interpret more complicated designs.

III. Statement of Course Need 
Honors courses in mathematics have been developed to provide mathematically 
talented students the opportunity to obtain a level of rigor not currently available in 
existing courses. This course is intended for those students who desire more 
background into the area of experimental design in statistics, especially those in 
psychology, education, or other social science programs. 

IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum 
A. Free Elective: This course serves as a one credit free math elective for all 
programs. 
B. Course transferability: This course transfers as a math course in most liberal arts 
programs. 
C. This course serves as a one-credit honors course.

2 


B. 
Learning Outcomes 
Students will be able to: 

1. 
Explain the possible interactions among the variables present in any 
design. 
2. 
Justify the error that can occur within any design and explain how to 
correct such error. 
3. 
Interpret the connection between ANOVA and regression. 
4. 
Interpret an ANOVA table for any design. 
5. 
Determine the appropriate design for different experimental 
situations. 
VII. Modes of Teaching and Learning 
Instructors can use a variety of modes including, but not limited to the following: 

A. lecture/discussion 
B. 
small-group work 
C. 
computer-assisted instruction 
D. student oral presentations 
E. student collaboration 
F. 
independent study 
VIII. Papers, Examinations, and other Assessment Instruments 
Student learning outcomes are assessed using a combination of the following: 

A. teacher written tests 
B. 
computer/calculator assignments 
C. 
semester projects 
D. final examination 
E. in-class or online quizzes & homework 
IX. Grade Determinants 
Final grades are determined by a combination of the following: 

A. tests 
B. quizzes 
C. homework 
D. projects 
E. assignments 
F. 
cumulative final exam 
X. 
Texts and Materials 
A. 
Any text in Research Design methods may be used such as, Data Analysis for 
Research Designs, by Keppel and Zedeck, 1989, modules that accompany the 
text, or handouts generated by the instructor. 
3 


B. Computer-based sources: The instructor is free to choose the type of technology. 
Choices include but are not limited to: 
1. MINITAB 
2. TI-84 graphing calculator 
3. EXCEL 
4. PASW (SPSS) 
5. SAS 
Please Note: The course outline is intended only as a guide to course content and 
resources. Do not purchase textbooks based on this outline. The RVCC Bookstore is 
the sole resource for the most up-to-date information about textbooks. 

XI. Resources 
Because of the technology used in the course, classes should be held in a computer 
room where the instructor and students can access both MINITAB and the web. 
MINITAB software needs to be available in S020, the open lab, and any other 
computer lab where students may be working.
