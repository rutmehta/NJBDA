Prerequisites:

To take MAT034, you must have met one of the following

requirements:

        Achieved a qualifying score on the New Jersey Basic

Skills Placement Test

        Successfully passed MAT033 at Mercer County Community

College

        Passed a course comparable to MAT033 which has been

approved by MCCC              personnel

Course Components:





Lecture:

The lecture is conducted twice each week (for daytime sections).

New concepts are presented and homework is assigned.

Additionally, you may be given quizzes, projects, or whatever

your instructor feels would be effective to help you learn.



Laboratory:

 For each lecture, there is a corresponding and required lab

experience which provides opportunity for individual and group

reinforcement of the skills taught.  Labsheets from the Lab

Workbook are assigned, completed, and corrected during this

supervised work period.



Attendance:

Attendance at lectures and lab sessions is mandatory.

Recognizing that personal problems can arise, the College permits

three absences.  Absences beyond three may result in your being

withdrawn form the course or may negatively affect your grade. If

you are unable to attend class, it would most beneficial to watch

the lesson you missed on television

 (cable channel 23) and then complete the corresponding labsheet

as well as the textbook assignment so as to keep up with the

course content.



Homework:

Homework is generally assigned after each class meeting.  It is

expected that each assignment be fully completed with all work

shown and with the date and page numbers designated.  The

Solutions Manual that accompanies the Larson text should provide

support if you are having difficulties with any of the assigned

problems.  Answers for odd numbered problems should be checked

with the key at the back of your text and corrections made where

necessary.  After questions are addressed at the onset of the

following class session, homework may be checked, collected, or

quizzes given to assess your understanding of the assignment.

If absent, you are expected to complete all homework, as well as

the days labsheet, so that you will have a foundation for

learning new material in the subsequent class.



Method of Evaluation:

     Tests:    There are 5 tests in the course, each with 25

questions based on objectives outlined for you prior to each

test.  These tests are administered in the Academic Testing

Center (LA215) and must be taken according to the dates specified

in the course agenda included in this syllabus.

The Testing Center is open during the following hours:

                                               Testing Weeks 1-7

No tests are distributed during the last 30 minutes before

closing time each day.   On each occasion that you go take a

test, you must bring your student identification card and a 2

pencil.

In addition to the 5 tests, there is a cumulative final exam

administered by your instructor during the designated final exam

week.



     Other Factors Affecting Your Grade:  In addition to tests,

other factors affecting your final course grade include:

quizzes, notebooks, your Test-Error Journal, and attendance.



     Determining Grades:  Your final course grade will be based

on the total number of raw score points you have earned during

the semester and will be determined according to the schedule

below:

     Total Possible Points                      of Total Points

repeat the entire course)

     You must pass the final exam (a minimum of 25 out of 35

correct or 71)

                     to pass the course, regardless of your total

point score.

     Additional points may be added to your total based on

factors indicated above.



Extra Help:   If you are having difficulties and need additional

support beyond the classroom and lab experience, get help

immediately.  Seek assistance from any or all of the following

resources:

           Statement of Appropriate Classroom Conduct

                                

                                

     Mercer County Community College welcomes all students into a

learning environment that creates a sense of community, of pride

and of respect. With that as our goal, students need to be aware

of their responsibilities and follow common rules of courtesy

during class sessions. Behaviors that disrupt or distract from

the learning process are unacceptable.



     Prompt arrival to class is assumed.  If a student is tardy,

it is expected that he/she choose a seat close to the entrance so

as not to disrupt others.  Leaving early without having informed

the instructor prior to class is not appropriate.  Unless there

is an emergency, leaving and returning while the class is in

session is not acceptable behavior.



     To enable students to stay focused on the class

lecture/discussion, only one person at a time should be speaking

side conversations are generally unacceptable. Similarly, pencil

sharpening while someone is speaking is unacceptable.



     Cell phones should be turned off completely before entering

the classroom.



     A student who:  a) knowingly represents the work of others

as his/her own,

b) uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in the execution of

any academic work, or

c) gives fraudulent assistance to another student is guilty of

cheating.

Violators will be penalized.











































                                

                                

                      Notebook Requirements



                                

     Students are required to keep a neat and legible notebook

that should fulfill the following requirements:



1)  The notebook should be of the three-ring variety.



2)  The notebook should begin with a title page giving your name,

the course title, course number and section number, and the time

and location of meeting.

In this way, if your notebook is misplaced, it can easily be

returned to you.



3)  The course syllabus  (course information) should follow the

title page.



4)  The course agenda  (list of daily lessons and test deadlines)

should be adhered to the front inside cover of the notebook so

that it is easily accessible.



5)  All of the following should be included in your notebook and

designated by dividers so that items can be easily located:

     Lecture Notes----

          Include daily notes taken in class which are dated and

          designated by corresponding text sections.

          Significant algebraic steps and procedures should be

          included and examples given for illustration.  Class

          notes missed because of your absence should be

          duplicated from a classmate and included.

          Include all explanatory handouts distributed in class.

     Lab Workbook----

          Include this by either keeping it in a pocket of your

          loose-leaf cover or by punching holes so it can be

          slipped on the loose-leaf rings.

     Lab Work---

          Include all completed and corrected lab assignments

          written on loose-leaf paper.

          All errors should be reworked so that you understand

          the entire assignment before leaving the lab period.

     

Homework---

           Include all daily assignments done on loose-leaf

paper.

Computer Test Printouts---

     Include all test printouts from the Testing Center.

                                   Losing these can be

problematic.

Test-Error Journal---

     Following each test printout, the student will list the

specific problem numbers he/she missed on that particular test

and then give a corresponding example of each, as designated by

the appropriate Test Objective Review Sheet.  Each problem should

be worked out so as to demonstrate understanding of correct

procedures.

     Extra credit can be earned by submitting this follow-up work

to the instructor within the allotted time period after each

test.
