II. Catalog Description 
Corequisites: MATH 112 Precalculus I, or MATH 113 Precalculus II, or MATH 
114H: Precalculus Honors. This course is designed as an honors component to 
supplement existing courses at the precalculus level. The course is intended to 
provide students with exposure to relevant ideas for future courses in Calculus. 
Topics include arithmetic and geometric sequences and sums, infinite series, the 
binomial theorem, mathematical induction, permutations, combinations and 
probability. 

III. Statement of Course Need 
Honors courses in mathematics have been developed to provide mathematically 
talented students the opportunity to obtain a level of rigor not currently available 
in existing courses. Topics in this course have been selected to supplement and 
enrich the curriculum of the co-requisite courses by providing additional theory 
and applications that will sharpen the students’ deductive and inductive reasoning

skills and empower them with the tools of symbolic language and methods to 
acquire mathematical knowledge most needed for the calculus series. 

IV. Place of Course in College Curriculum 
A. This course serves as a one credit free math elective for all programs. 
B. This course transfers as a math course in most liberal arts programs. 
V. Outline of Course Content 
A. 
General Sequences and Sums 
B. 
Arithmetic Sequence and series 
C. 
Geometric Sequence and series 
D. 
Infinite Series 
E. 
The Binomial Theorem 
F. 
Mathematical Induction 
G. 
Counting Principles 
H. 
Applications of the Counting Principles, Sequences and Series 
VI. Educational Goals and Learning Outcomes 
A. Educational Goals 
Students will: 

1. 
apply mathematical arguments to problems. (G. E. 1) 
2. 
solve problems quantitatively and symbolically. (G. E. 7) 
B. Learning Outcomes 
Students will be able to: 

1. 
use mathematical induction as a method of proof. 
2. 
state the properties of an arithmetic sequence and a geometric 
sequence and find the nth term and the sum of each. 
3. 
define a sequence, a sequence of partial sums, and an infinite 
series and distinguish between all three mathematical objects. 
4. 
define the Binomial Theorem and use it to expand a binomial 
expression and find its nth term 
5. 
apply the counting principle and the formulas for combinations 
and permutations to problems.
