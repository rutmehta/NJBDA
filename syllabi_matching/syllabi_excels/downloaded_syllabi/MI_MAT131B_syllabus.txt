Catalog Course Description:



The second half of the two-semester sequence of Analytic Geometry and 
Calculus 

I.  Presents the fundamental ideas of calculus such as the derivative, 
integral, 

and their applications.  Topics include fundamentals of analytic geometry 
and 

transcendental functions.  This completes the first course in a sequence of 

calculus courses intended for the student interested in mathematics, 

engineering, and the natural, physical and social sciences. TI 83 plus 

calculator required.



Objectives of Course:



The student will demonstrate through quizzes, examinations, homework and 

projects the ability to:

1.Identify, comprehend, and manipulate abstract symbols and their use in a 

variety of situations.

2.Establish strong conceptual foundations.

3.Analyze mathematical situations with ideas and problem solving techniques.

4.Make decisions about solving complex problems.

5.Establish underlying mathematical models for conceptual understanding.

6.Understand and analyze data intelligently in technologically advanced 

society.
