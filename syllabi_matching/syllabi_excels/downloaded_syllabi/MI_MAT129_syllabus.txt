Catalog Course Description:



Emphasis on those topics from algebra and trigonometry that best prepare 
student 

for the first course in calculus.  The areas of study are algebraic and 

transcendental functions and their graphs.  Of special interest are 
polynomials, 

rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.  Additional 

topics include vectors, polar coordinate systems, matrices, and 
determinants. 





Objectives of Course:

1.To acquire the working knowledge of college algebra needed for later study 

and work.



2.To use a scientific graphing calculator, computer software, and other 

resources as problem solving tools.



3.To develop awareness of the contributions of mathematicians from various 

cultures and countries. The syllabus represents the basic minimum to be 
covered 

by an instructor.  If time permits, suggested additional topics:  vector, 

matrices, polar coordinates.





Students enrolled in MAT-129 will be required to or have access to a TI 83 

calculator.
