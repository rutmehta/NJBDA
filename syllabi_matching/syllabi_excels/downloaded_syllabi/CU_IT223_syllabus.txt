Description: Provides an understanding of equilibrium of particles and rigid bodies subject to concentrated and distributed forces.  Upon successful completion of this course, the students should be able to analyze problems involving the equilibrium of particles and rigid bodies, including simple machines, trusses, and frictional forces.

Learning Outcomes:

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Perform standard vector operations including addition, subtraction, Dot and Cross products
* Resolve vectors into components along prescribed directions
* Perform equilibrium analysis of rigid bodies
* Determine equivalent systems of forces and couples
* Perform equilibrium and structural analysis of trusses and frames
* Determine centroids and moments of inertia of various areas
* Perform equilibrium analysis of impending motion including frictional forces

Topical Outline:

* Introduction: Units, Concepts, Fundamentals
* Force Vectors, Unit Vectors, Equilibrium of a Particle
* Forces in Space: Rectangular Components, Equilibrium

Student Assessment:

Students’ evaluation in the subject will be based on 3 examinations, assignments, team projects and a final project.

3 Exams				40%
      Assignments				20%
      Final Exam				40%

Attendance:

Attendance is required.  Please see instructor for make-up policy for excused and school related absences.

Academic Integrity:

	Plagiarism is cheating.  Plagiarism is presenting in written work, in public speaking, and in oral reports the ideas or exact words of someone else without proper documentation.

	Whether the act of plagiarism is deliberate or accidental [ignorance of the proper rules for handling material is no excuse], plagiarism is, indeed, a “criminal” offense. As such, a plagiarized paper or report automatically receives a grade of ZERO and the student may receive a grade of F for the semester at the discretion of the instructor.

Tutoring & Project Assist:

	If you are having difficulty with work in this class tutoring is available through the Center for Academic & Student Success.  If you think that you might have a learning disability, contact Project Assist at 856.691.8600 x 1282 for information on assistance that can be provided to eligible students.

Before Withdrawing From This Course:

If a student experiences adverse circumstances while enrolled in this course and considers withdrawing, s/he should see an advisor (division or advisement center) BEFORE withdrawing from the class.  A withdrawal may cause harmful repercussions to completion rate standards and overall GPA which can limit or eliminate future financial aid in addition to causing academic suspension.
