Academic Integrity Statement:



A student who a.) knowingly represents work of others as his/her

own b.) uses or obtains unauthorized assistance in the execution

of any work or c.) gives fraudulent assistance to another student

is guilty of cheating. Violators will be penalized. (Student

Handbook)



Classroom Conduct Statement:



It is the students responsibility to attend all of their classes.

If they miss a class meeting for any reason, students are

responsible for all content that is covered, for announcements made

in their absence, and for acquiring any materials that may have

been distributed in class. It is expected that students be on time

for all their classes. If students walk into a class after it had

begun, it is expected that they choose a seat close to where they

entered the room so they do not disrupt the class meeting.



Students are expected to follow ordinary rules of courtesy during

class session. Engaging in private, side conversations during class

time is distracting to other students and to the instructor.

Leaving class early without having informed the instructor prior to

class is not appropriate. Unless there is an emergency, leaving

class and returning while class is in session is not acceptable

behavior. Disruptive behavior of any type, including sharpening

pencils during class while someone is speaking, is not appropriate.



The college welcomes all students into an environment that creates

a sense of community and pride and respect we are all here to work

cooperatively and to learn together.
