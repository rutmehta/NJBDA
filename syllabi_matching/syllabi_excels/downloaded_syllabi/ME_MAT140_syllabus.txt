Evaluation of student learning

Quizzes, exams, class participation and projects will be used to determine the student’s grade.   Instructors may also choose to incorporate graded homework assignments.   Unit tests will be administered in class, with the questions selected to reflect the above student learning outcomes for each unit.  The final exam will be comprehensive and will reflect the goals for the course.

It is suggested that the instructor use the following grading rubric to determine the student’s level of success in this course:

Academic Integrity Statement:  

Mercer County Community College is committed to academic integrity – the honest, fair and continuing pursuit of knowledge, free from fraud or deception.
* Students should never:
o Knowingly represent the work of others as their own
o Knowingly represent previously completed academic work as current
o Fabricate data to support academic work
o Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in the execution of any academic work
o Give fraudulent assistance to other students
o Unethically use technological means to gain academic advantages

Violators of the above actions will be penalized.  For a single violation the faculty member will determine the course of action.  This may include, assigning a lower grade on the assignment, lowering the course grade, failing the student, or another penalty that is appropriate to the violation.  The student will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee, who may impose other penalties for a second (or later) violation.  The student has right to a hearing and also to appeal any decisions.  These rights are outlined in the student handbook.
