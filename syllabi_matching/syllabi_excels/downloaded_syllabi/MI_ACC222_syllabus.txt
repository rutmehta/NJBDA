DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION:

The study of computer-aided data analysis techniques for detecting and 

investigating fraud cases, issues related to the collection and use of 

digital evidence and collection of data from electronic devices.



OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES



1.Perform a risk assessment given a specific scenario, fact pattern or 

dataset with particular attention to IT controls, threats and 

exposures.

2.Apply the rules for the appropriate handling and custody of evidence in 

an investigative scenario.

3.Demonstrate how to use the internet and other resources to investigate 

and collect evidence.

4.Identify and utilize digital evidence in a case scenario.

5.Recognize situations that require information security or computer 

forensic specialists.

6.List and describe the rules of e-discovery and be able to explain the 

impact of e-discovery on policies related to records retention, 

appropriate use of e-mail, etc.

7.Demonstrate how forensic accountants interact with other specialists in 

coordinating vulnerability testing, ethical hacking or intrusion 

detection.





8. Articulate how various types of fraud would manifest themselves in 

company records and identify the issues related to computerized audit 

tools and techniques (CAATTS) engagements, and identify necessary 

expertise.

9. Generate and test hypotheses to distinguish between errors and actual 

fraud and to resolve ambiguous and conflicting evidence.

10. Utilize at least one generalized audit software package (such as ACL) 

for data extraction.

11. Analyze and discuss the techniques of regressions and simulations, 

data-mining, pattern recognition, horizontal and vertical analysis, 

analysis of journal entries in a digital environment and other digital 

analysis.

12. Link analysis packages, such as Analysts Notebook, in order to 

present 

data using timelines and themes.

13. Identify situations where a forensic computer specialist must be 

retained so that legal proceedings against a perpetrator will not be 

jeopardized if evidence is gathered by an investigator who lacks 

appropriate skills.

14. Demonstrate the method of documenting and presenting the results 

of the 

work performed.

15. Differentiate situations that violate criminal laws, rights to 

privacy 

and other related issues by learning and understanding the basic knowledge 

of types of cyber-crime, intellectual property and privacy laws related to 

cyber-crime (e.g., relevant sections of USC Title 18).

16. Develop prevention programs to prevent, deter and detect the use of IT 

systems to commit fraud and other criminal acts.
