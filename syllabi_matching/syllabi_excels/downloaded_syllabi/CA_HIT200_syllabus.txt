Course Description/Goals:     This course will build on the

information presented in Elements of Statistics (MTH 111).

The objective of this course is to target the student to the

application of statistical methods in the field of Health

Information Technology. Specific ratios and rates directly

related to the acute care medical environment will be a part

of classroom discussion. Practical application of class

lectures will be completed.  The concepts of data

presentation, computerization of statistics, and the

application of this information to non-acute care medical

environments will also be addressed.  It is important that

students have strong familiarity with this information since

it can be a vital part of job duties for Health Information

Technology Technicians.
