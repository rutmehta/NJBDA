DETAILED COURSE DESCRIPTION:



This course presents an introduction to programming and problem solving 
using 

Java.  

Algorithm development and basic procedural and object-oriented problem 
solving 

techniques are introduced.  Fundamental topics of computer programming 
including 

sequence, selection, repetition, input/output, methods, parameter passing, 

scope, 

lifetime, and arrays are discussed in detail.  Basic concepts of 
object-oriented 

programming such as objects, classes and class methods are introduced. This 

course 

is required of all Computer Science transfer students.  The course is also 

recommended for students in other programs seeking a rigorous introduction 
to 

computer programming.





OUTLINE OF COURSE OBJECTIVES

1.Identify the functional units of a computer system and describe how 

information 

flows from one unit to another.



2.Describe the basic steps involved in entering, running and testing a 

program.



3.Identify and construct legal Java statements.



4.   Demonstrate an understanding of Java Input/Output methods.



5.Demonstrate the effective use of the scalar data types of real, integer, 

boolean, 

and character.



6.Demonstrate the structured programming control concepts of sequence, 

selection and repetition in the Java language.



7.Define and demonstrate the effective use of methods.



8.        Demonstrate how to declare and manipulate objects



9.        Demonstrate how to use String objects and methods of the String 
Class 



10.Demonstrate the use of parameters, local and global variables.



11.Demonstrate how to declare and manipulate arrays.



12.Demonstrate the ability to write well-structured and properly documented 

source 

programs that accept input data, solve a specified problem and present 
solutions 

in an effective manner.
