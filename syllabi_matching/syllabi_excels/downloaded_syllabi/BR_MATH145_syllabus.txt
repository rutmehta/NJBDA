VIII.Detailed Course Description

This course is an intermediate algebra course with examples drawn from real 
life and skills learned in the context of these applications. Students learn 
about functions and their properties and explore in depth linear, quadratic, 
polynomial, rational and exponential functions. Problems are explored from 
graphical, numerical, verbal and algebraic perspectives.  For each topic 
studied, the student will be able to explain the basic concepts and apply 
them to the solution of specific problems. 



This course is designed for students who have passed an elementary algebra 
course. This course does not satisfy the prerequisite for MATH 152, 
Trigonometry or MATH 153, Precalculus. This course may be used as a 
prerequisite for MATH 146, Advanced Topics in Mathematics for the Liberal 
Arts and for MATH 156, Mathematics for Management and the Social Sciences.
