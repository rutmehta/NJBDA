Course Competencies/Goals:  
As this is a foundation level mathematics course, the course should first and foremost prepare the students for future college level work in mathematics.  The students should develop confidence in their abilities to perform mathematics successfully.  They should gain experiences that connect their classroom learning with real-world applications of mathematics and be able to build techniques of reasoning for effective problem solving that they can translate to other settings.

The student will be able to:
I. Develop a strategy for solving linear equations and inequalities.
II. Generate graphs of linear equations with two unknowns to provide visual solutions for both single equations as well as systems of equations.
III. Synthesize the rules of exponents and polynomial operations to simplify algebraic expressions to a standard form.
IV. Distinguish polynomials in order to apply correct techniques of factoring.
V. Adapt the techniques of factoring polynomials to solve quadratic equations.
VI. Apply the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to both rational expressions and radical expressions.


Course-specific General Education Knowledge Goals and Core Skills. 

General Education Knowledge Goals
Goal 2. Mathematics. Students will use appropriate mathematical and statistical concepts and operations to interpret data and to solve problems.

MCCC Core Skills
Goal B. Critical Thinking and Problem-solving. Students will use critical thinking and problem solving skills in analyzing information.
Goal F. Collaboration and Cooperation. Students will develop the interpersonal skills required for effective performance in group situations.

As this is a mathematics course, by nature all the learning objectives support the General Education Goal 2.  However, this is a foundations level course and as such it is not expected that the students would use this course as a general education course.

Evaluation of student learning:   

Grade will be based on the following percentages:

Midterm:  50%                            Final:  50%


The midterm will be comprised of all multiple choice questions.  It will cover the material for the first three units.

The final is comprehensive and passing the final is required to pass the class.  

Academic Integrity Statement:  

Mercer County Community College is committed to academic integrity – the honest, fair and continuing pursuit of knowledge, free from fraud or deception.
* Students should never:
o Knowingly represent the work of others as their own
o Knowingly represent previously completed academic work as current
o Fabricate data to support academic work
o Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in the execution of any academic work
o Give fraudulent assistance to other students
o Unethically use technological means to gain academic advantages

Violators of the above actions will be penalized.  For a single violation the faculty member will determine the course of action.  This may include, assigning a lower grade on the assignment, lowering the course grade, failing the student, or another penalty that is appropriate to the violation.  The student will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee, who may impose other penalties for a second (or later) violation.  The student has right to a hearing and also to appeal any decisions.  These rights are outlined in the student handbook.
