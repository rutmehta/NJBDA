Catalog Course Description:

The first half of the two-semester sequence of Analytic Geometry and 
Calculus I. 

Presents fundamental ideas of calculus such as the derivative, integral, and 

their applications.  Topics include fundamentals of analytic geometry and 

transcendental functions.  The first course in a sequence of calculus 
courses 

intended for the student interested in mathematics, engineering, and the 

natural, physical and social sciences.  TI 83 plus calculator required.



Objectives of Course:

The student will demonstrate through quizzes, examinations, homework and 

projects the ability to:

1.Identify, comprehend, and manipulate abstract symbols and their uses in a 

variety of situations.

2.Establish strong conceptual foundations.

3.Analyze mathematical situations with ideas and problem solving techniques.

4.Make decisions about solving complex problems.

5.Establish underlying mathematical models for conceptual understanding.
