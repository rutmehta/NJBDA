•	Class-folder due dates sheet;
•	Hand-outs from this class;
•	Graded assignments, quizzes, tests;
•	Your weekly journal entry;
•	Your weekly assignment.

You are required to hand in this class-folder each week, at least twenty-four hours prior to your class meeting time.  

Record of Grades:  When an assignment, quiz, or test is returned to you by your
MAT-280 instructor, record your grade on this item on the class-folder due dates sheet.  When you complete corrections to the graded item, attach the corrections to the graded item and place these papers in your class-folder.  

Weekly Journal Entry:  Each student is to keep a weekly journal.  Your weekly journal entry must include:
•	A summary of the material covered in your MAT-280 class during the past week.  This summary is to be written legibly and in good English.

In order to pass MAT-092, a student must complete the journal entries, complete the assignments, and not exceed the one absence limit.  If a student hands in the class-folder each week, with all journal entries and all assignments completed, the letter grade for this course will be an “A”.  The letter grade for this course will be a “B” if the student hands in the class-folder all but one week; the letter grade for this course will be a “C” if the student hands in the class-folder all but two weeks.  If a student fails to hand in the in the class-folder for three or more weeks, the letter grade will be an “F”.  If a student has more than one absence, the letter grade will be an “E”.
