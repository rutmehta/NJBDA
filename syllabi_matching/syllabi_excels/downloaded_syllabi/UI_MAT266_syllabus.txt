COURSE NAME & NUMBER:  MAT266 Survey of Modern Mathematics 


COURSE DESCRIPTION
              
This course provides a transition to higher mathematics and introduces the basic methods 
of proofs. Topics include number theory, elementary symbolic logic, set theory, basic 
methods of mathematical proofs, relations and functions, as well as the theory of 
mathematical thinking and writing. 
Prerequisite: Grade of 'C' or better in Calculus I or permission of the department chair 
Corequisite: Calculus II 
3 Lecture Hours Per Week 
3 Credit Hours

RATIONALE & STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to writing and proving 
mathematical statements. Many students have no familiarity with proofs, which is the 
most important concept in higher mathematics courses. They also have little experience 
writing and interpreting mathematical theorems. This course seeks to provide those skills 
and experiences. In addition, this course will be a prerequisite to advanced mathematics 
courses and will be required for mathematics and mathematics education majors.

Similar courses are offered at William Paterson University, New Jersey City University, 
Monmouth University, and Drew University supporting the transferability of this course.

Student Learning Outcomes:  

At the end of this course, the successful student will be able to:

a)	Identify propositions 
b)	Distinguish the different logical connectives
c)	Construct truth tables  
d)	Compare and use the different techniques of proofs 
e)	Determine if a given relation is a function
f)	Determine the cardinality of sets.

 These content driven objectives fall within the broader scope of the following general 
education objectives for mathematics.



Students will:

>	Translate quantifiable problems into mathematical terms and solve these problems 
using mathematical operations.
>	Identify a problem and analyze it in terms of its significant parts and the 
information needed to solve it.
>	Formulate and evaluate possible solutions to problems, and select and defend the 
chosen solutions.
>	Solve problems, applying mathematical strategies.
>	Communicate and discuss mathematical problems and solutions.
>	Comprehend and evaluate mathematical resources.
>	Write clear and logical arguments/discussions on mathematical topics.
>	Learn independently and direct their own course of learning and specialization 
and be able to present those findings to a group of peers.
